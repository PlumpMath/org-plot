#+TITLE:     Plotting with org-plot
#+AUTHOR:    Eric Schulte

#+LANGUAGE:  en
#+TEXT:      This is an example org-mode file to demonstrate plotting using org-plot

So first we need to load file:org-plot.el, this can be done using the
following link.

[[elisp:(progn (add-to-list 'load-path "./") (load "org-plot.el"))]]

Use the next elisp link to bind the org-plot plotting command
=org-plot/gnuplot= to =C-M-g= for easy calling.

[[elisp:(local-set-key "\M-\C-g" 'org-plot/gnuplot)]]

Now to look at some tables and their plots.  First to plot the
following table use the key sequence defined above =C-M-g=.  This will
find and plot the nearest table (I hope to build this behavior into a
=plot:= link).  The options specified in any #+PLOT lines are read
touching the table are read and applied to the plot.  For a complete
list of all of the options and their meanings see the [[file:org-plot.el::org%20plot%20gnuplot%20options][options-comment]]
in org-plot.el.

There are also some functions for plotting 3d or grid data.  To see an
example of a grid plot call org-plot/gnuplot =C-M-g= which will plot
the following table as a grid.

To see the effect of =map= try setting it to t, and then re-plotting.

Plotting grids also respects the independent variable (=ind:=) option,
and uses the values of the independent row to label the resulting
graph.  The following example borrows a short description of org-mode
from Bernt Hansen on the mailing list (a more practical usage would
label every single row with something informative).
