org-plot.el --- Plotting from within org-mode

Currently this provides functions for dumping information from
org-mode tables to gnuplot.  Hopefully as this becomes more
general/stable it will be incorporated into org-mode.

See:
 Emacs        | http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ 
 Orgmode      | http://orgmode.org/
 Gnuplot      | http://www.gnuplot.info/
 Gnuplot-Mode | http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/gnuplot-mode.html

   instruction to load org-plot.el, and begin generating graphs of
